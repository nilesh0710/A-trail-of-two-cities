# A-trail-of-two-cities

Instructions:  
1) Open the index.html file.  
2) Enter the first location in the "Enter Location" box and press enter, then it will create a marker at that location. 
3) Now enter the second city in the same "Enter Location" box and press enter to create a marker and line to connect both the cities.   
Notes:  Right now I am just using cities for autocomplete, if you want to search for complete address for autocomplete the please do remove line number: 59 from index.html and then it will suggest whole address.
